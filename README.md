# My name's Marvin

I've been born in 1996 and started programming at the age of 14. My dad bought me an XHTML book with over 1000 pages and since then, I have created a passion for computers and especially for the internet. My first computer was an Macintosh 2000 where I loved to play [Cro-Mag Ralley](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7730-cro-mag-rally) a lot.

You can get in touch with me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/muuvmuuv) and if you wanna play some [League of Legends](https://leagueoflegends.com/) with me add [my tag `muuvmuuv`](https://lolprofile.net/summoner/euw/muuvmuuv). I also play some Word of Warcraft in my free time or work on side projects.
